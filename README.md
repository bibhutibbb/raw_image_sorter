# RAW File Sorter

This is an easy-to-use executable application for photographers and content creators to organize RAW image files by matching them to JPEG files.

---

## How It Works

- You must have an Excel file **anyname.xlsx** inside your JPEG folder.
- This Excel file should contain a list of JPEG file names (e.g., DSC_5805.JPG) in the first column.
- Sample .xlsx file is available in the git.
- The app reads the Excel file to know which JPEGs to consider.
- When you select the JPEG folder and the RAW folder, the app finds RAW files matching the JPEG names from the Excel and copies them to the output folder.

## Features

- Supports multiple RAW formats (.cr2, .cr3, .nef, .arw, .dng, .raf, .orf, .rw2).
- Drag and drop support for folder selection.
- Modern UI with status messages.
- Professional credits and donate button.

## Requirements

- Windows 7+

## Basic Usage

1. Place **anyname.xlsx** with JPEG names inside your JPEG folder.
2. Run the executable or the app.
3. Select the JPEG folder (with anyname.xlsx), RAW folder, and output folder.
4. Click 'Sort RAW Files'.
5. The app copies matching RAW files based on Excel's JPEG list to the output folder.

# File Sorter v3.0.0.0

This application provides a simple yet powerful solution for organizing files by matching their names against an Excel or CSV spreadsheet. It streamlines your workflow by copying or moving files into a designated output folder, making your file collection easily manageable.

## Features

-   **Spreadsheet-Driven Sorting**: Automatically identifies and sorts files based on filenames listed in an Excel (`.xlsx`) or CSV (`.csv`) file.
-   **Flexible Operations**: Choose to either `Copy` the matched files to a new destination, or `Move` them (cutting them from the source and pasting to the destination).
-   **Drag-and-Drop Support**: Conveniently select your Excel/CSV file, source folder, and output folder using drag-and-drop functionality directly onto the respective input fields.
-   **User-Friendly Interface**: A straightforward graphical user interface (GUI) allows for easy selection of input files and folders, and initiation of the sorting process.
-   **Progress Tracking & Cancellation**: Provides real-time progress updates during sorting and allows you to cancel an ongoing operation.
-   **Error Handling**: Offers clear feedback on sorting progress and any encountered issues.

7.  **Start Sorting**: Once all selections are made, click the "Sort Files" button to begin the automated sorting process. A progress bar and status messages will keep you informed.
